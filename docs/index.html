                <p>
                    FakeAwake started as a silly little project to understand the process of developing a Discord Bot.
                    My
                    curious little brain was really interested in how bots worked and how I could make my own bot. At
                    first
                    it was just a one off little project since people seemed to like FakeAwake a lot I decided to
                    maintain
                    it and improve it and make it the best bot ever! My goal with FakeAwake is to create a general
                    purpose
                    bot that also has specific features that people would like, while also making a bot that behaves
                    natrually like a normal person by implementing AI and Natrual Language capabilities. Overtime the
                    FakeAwake project had expanded and a twitch bot was born, maybe more will come in the future. Feel
                    free
                    to peak through the code and/or even invite FakeAwake to your own Discord server using the link
                    above.
