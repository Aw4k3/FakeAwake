FakeAwake started as a silly little project to understand the process of developing a Discord Bot. My curious little brain was really interested in how bots worked and how I could make my own bot. At first it was just a one off little project since people seemed to like FakeAwake a lot I decided to maintain it and improve it and make it the best bot ever! My goal with FakeAwake is to create a general purpose bot that also has specific features that people would like, while also making a bot that behaves natrually like a normal person by implementing AI and Natrual Language capabilities. Overtime the FakeAwake project had expanded and a twitch bot was born, maybe more will come in the future. Feel free to peak through the code and/or even invite FakeAwake to your own Discord server using the link above.
